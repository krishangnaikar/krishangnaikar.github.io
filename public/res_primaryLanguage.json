      "description": "üëãüèªHey there! I'm Krishang Naikar, a student at Orion High School. I have completed Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program which was super interesting. I also finished Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera - Ng is a professor at Stanford and a real expert in the field. I'm excited about learning all the new advancements happening in artificial intelligence and machine learning. These areas fascinate me and I pick up new concepts quickly. My goal is to one day work on cutting-edge AI and ML Computer Vision projects that really push the boundaries of what's possible. But for now, I'm focused on building a strong educational foundation and absorbing as much knowledge as I can.",
